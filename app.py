        * **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
        * **Avoid Stimulants:** Limit caffeine and nicotine, especially in the afternoon and evening.
        * **Limit Screen Time Before Bed:** Avoid electronic devices (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) at least an hour before sleep.
